# FinalProject_Team7
### Toronto Raptors Analysis
#### 2018-2019 NBA Champion
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze Raptors performance during their participation in the 2018 -2019 NBA Championship. The goal is to analyze their performance based on various parameters (i.e. Shots, Passes, Fouls, Turnover, etc.). We will also perform Machine Learning on this data. We hope to explore various ML models that predict the game outcome based on a variety of factors. We will use accuracy as the measure to determine which ML model would work best.

This analysis will also aid coaches, sponsors and players, in better understanding their teams performance based on variables outlined in the analysis.

## Questions we want to answer
In order for our analysis to be fruitful, we will focus on the following key questions:
 1. Win-Loss Percentage based on Away/Home (Team)
 2. Minutes Played vs Overall Score (Player)
 3. Attempts vs Made Shots Overall (Player or Team)
 4. Number of Assists vs Points Made Overall (Team)
 5. Number of Turnover vs Points Made Overall (Team)
 6. Overall Parameters vs Team Outcome - Key Parameters (i.e. Shots, Passes, Fouls, Turnover, etc.)

## Group communication protocols
- Regular communication through Slack Channel. This includes sharing information that we find online, code & arranging meetings.
- Overall tasks checklist. We basically split the task amongst ourselves and define deadlines for certain tasks.

## Database

As outlined in the project goal, the team intends to use the 2018-2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors dataset available in Kaggle. Though the data size is small and can be handled as flat files for the analysis, the team formalized a data structure which could be scalable to accommodate any future data through a star schema with dimension tables around players and matchup teams and fact tables around game metrics at game and player level. Refer the below ERD for understanding of the data structure.

![ERD](/Resources/Raptor_ERD_updated.png)

This data structure is considered to be a scalable model, with

DIMENSION
- Players
- Teams 
- Regulars
- PlayOffs 

FACT
- RegularPlayers
- PlayoffsPlayers

A basic sanity cleansing activity was performed and certain vlookup functions were performed to establish new columns to have the schema outlined in the ERD. The team decide to ingest the cleaned data for the analysis into SQL database rather than handling them as flat files. We intend to move the data into a PostgreSQL database and create tables as per the ERD for further analysis. 

The csv files were cleansed for basic sanity and some formatting changes to the columns, the database and tables were created as per the sql file below inline with the ERD.

[schema.sql](/Resources/raptors_schema.sql)

The csv's were then imported into the respective tables and the below image outlines the records in the relevant tables

## Machine Learning
Using the Raptors 2018-2019 Championship season data set we hope to  explore different machine learning models. The models we hope to use include oversampling, undersampling and combination sampling algorithms. Additionally we hope to use Ensemble learners; in using these we hope to extract feature importance. Overall the algorithms we will use are:
- RandomOverSampler
- SMOTE
- ClusterCentroids
- SMOTEENN
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier
- EasyEnsembleClassifier

### Primary ML Goal:
We hope to evaluate the performance of each model and make recomendations based on which model is the most accurate at predicting game outcome.

### Basic Data Cleaning and Input/Output Selection
The columns present in the dataset that we will be using are featured in the figure below:

![columns in raptors_regulars.PNG](/Resources/Images/columns%20in%20raptors_regulars.PNG)

From these columns we will exclude the TEAM, MATCHUP, and Score (+/-). The X features will be the remaining columns excluding that which will be our target. Our target coulmn will be y = "W/L", this represents the outcome of the match.

After the appropriate data cleaning (joining the regular season and playoff data, removing null and missing data, and dropping the appropriate columns) we will use the above describe X and y to split the data into training and testing data sets. Using these data sets the models listed above will be evaluated.

### Week 2 ML: Building the ML Code

The ML analysis that was completed can be found in the notebook below:

[Raptors_Resampling_ML.ipynb](/Machine%20Learning%20Analysis/Raptors_Resampling_ML.ipynb)

The following steps were followed in to complete the ML analysis:

1) Preliminiary data preprocessing

   During this stage two datasets were joined. Team match data for the regular and playoff season was avaliable; this data was loaded into Jupyter notebook and was the concatenated togather as they had identical column headers.

   To prepare the data for the ML algorithms columns that were not going to be used were dropped, the target column was converted to an integer datatype and any null data was also dropped.

   - From the Columns in the figure above Four columns were excluded: DATE, TEAM, MATCHUP, and Score (+/-). These columns included data that we believed would not be helpful to include in the ML algorithms. The DATE column gave us the date for each game which would be different for each data point and different between seasons. The TEAM column was redundant and stated that each data point was for a Raptor's game. The MATCHUP column told us the team the Raptors were playing against. Finally, the +/- column gave a metric of how much the Raptors won or lost by; we felt this had no predictive value.
   - It is possible that both the DATE and MATCHUP columns could provide some predicitve value if we look at performance for say a particular month or against a particular team however we belive this would require more data from other seasons as having only one seasons data limits the usability of this data within a ML model.

   - The target column for this analysis was the W/L column; this told us if the Raptors had won or lost that game. We hope to see which model could most accuratly predict if the Raptors would win or loose a game. This column was initially an object datatype. This was converted into an integer where W = 0 and L = 1.

   - Finally, The data was then checked for null values; any null values were dropped.

2) Preliminary Feature Selection

   As stated above the desired columns/features had already been retained and the target column had been selected.

   The features were created:

   ![Features Created.PNG](/Resources/Images/Features%20Created.PNG)

   The target was selected:

   ![Target Selected.PNG](/Resources/Images/Target%20Selected.PNG)

3) Splitting the Data to training and testing sets

   The sklearn.model_selection train_test_split was then used to split the data. The default test and train size was used meaning the test size was set to 0.25 and the train size then automatically complemented that.

4) Preliminary Model Choice

   For this analysis we wanted to evaluate different models to see which would be the most accurate at predicting Wins vs Losses. The benefit of this is that we hope to be able to extract the most accurate model by looking at many models as opposed to only trying one and hoping that it was the best one. The limitation of this is that since we are considering accuracy as the measure of which model is best, it is possible we miss considereing the precision and sensitivity (recall) of each model, and how this may better represent whether the model is good or not.

   With the current analysis the best ML algorithm based on accuracy is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with a balanced accuracy score of 86.7%. 
   
### Week 3: Refining Model Choice

Results from the ML algorithms are found below:

#### 1. RandomOverSampler

      a. Balanced Accuray: 85.8%
      
      b. Precision: 86%
      
      c. Recall: 85%

#### 2. SMOTE

      a. Balanced Accuray: 80%
      
      b. Precision: 83%
      
      c. Recall: 81%

#### 3. ClusterCentroids

      a. Balanced Accuray: 85%
      
      b. Precision: 85%
      
      c. Recall: 85%
      
#### 4. SMOTEENN

      a. Balanced Accuray: 80%
      
      b. Precision: 85%
       
      c. Recall: 78%

#### 5. BalancedRandomForestClassifier

      a. Balanced Accuray: 75%
      
      b. Precision: 76%
      
      c. Recall: 74%
      
   **Feature Importance Analysis:**
      
   ![Feature Importance Analysis.PNG](/Resources/Images/Feature%20Importance%20Analysis.PNG)
      
   From this feature analysis we see that minutes played (MIN) and personal fouls (PF) were of the least importance when running this model. 

#### 6. EasyEnsembleClassifier

      a. Balanced Accuray: 86.7%
      
      b. Precision: 89%
      
      c. Recall: 85%

From the results of the ML analysis described above we can see that the EasyEnsembleClassifier model was the most accurate (86.7%). It is important to note that there were two other models that displayed similar accuracy scores: RandomOverSampler (85.8%) and ClusterCentroids (85%). For future analysis it may be interesting to add further historical data of previous seasons to see if the results remain the same. It would also be interesting to see what feature importances persist in this case with more data.

Finally, I would recommend the use of the EasyEnsembleClassifier model due to it having the highest accuracy score of all the models. A limitation of this model however is that it can be sewnsative to outliers and noise therefore care has to be put to identify if outliers exist in the avaliablke data. Future steps could include outlier analysis and exclusion to perhaps improve the outcomes of this model.

## Project Dashboard
To complete the visualization for the Toronto Raptors 2018-2019 NBA Championship, we utilized Tableau to create Dashboards. We also used Tableau Prep Builder to clean, sanitize, and process the data. We have created the following Dashboards:
1. Raptors - Players Stats <br>
This dashboard has multiple components which focus on player stats, and portrays the following information: <br>
a. Annual Player Score based on Year: Overall player score based on yearly cumulative <br>
b. Minutes Played vs Overall Score: Correlates the time a player spent on the court, to the points made by them <br>
c. Player Performance: Provides insight on each players performance (i.e. scores) <br>
d. Free Throw Attempts vs Made: Correlates the Free Throw Attempts and the Free Throws Made <br>
e. Overall Summary: Provides a high level breakdown of all the different stats of each player <br>
<br><img src="/Resources/Images/Raptors-Player-Stats.gif" width="700" height="500"/> <br>

2. Raptors - Team Stats <br>
This dasuboard has multiple components which focus on team stats, and analyze the following information: <br>
a. Annual Team Score Summary: Provides an overall summary of the Teams Wins and Losses, in relation to their location (i.e. Home or Away) <br>
b. Monthly Breakdown of Match's Played: Overall monthly breakdown of the teams Wins and Losses <br>
c. Win-Loss Based on Score: Correlates the Wins and Losses, with the overall score made by the team <br>
d. Overall Summary: Provides a high level breakdown of all the different stats for the team <br>
<br><img src="/Resources/Images/Raptors-Team-Stats.gif" width="700" height="500"/>
<br>
The above information can be used by the Team, Coach, Sponsonrs, etc, which will aid in improving performance, evaluating various parameters, etc. The link to the above dahsboards is mentioned below. 

## Conclusion ##
### Summary ###
Using the 2018-2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors data, we were able to analyze various aspects (i.e. Shots, Passes, Fouls, Turnover, etc.) which help us in perdicting and measuring the individual player's and teams performance. We were able to concur the following from our analysis:
- The Team has won more games when they have played in their Home Location weather it is Regular or Playoff.
- Regardless of location of the game (i.e. Home or Away), Kawhi Leonard was the best player to score the hightest points overall.
- Pascal Siakam (Raptors Forward Player) had the best high Field Goal percentage, with high rate of wins in this season.

### Plausible Uses and Improvements ###
- The data we used to analyze was only for a particular season which they happen to win. This analysis can help the Toronto Raptors Board to extend the contract of the high performing players based on the various parameters.
- This analysis also helps in understanding areas of improvement for the up coming young players (freshmen). 
- Appart from the champship data, we have to evaluate other data such as regular games, scoring postions, frehmen performance and the type of goal the players are good at. This will help formulate a strong team.
